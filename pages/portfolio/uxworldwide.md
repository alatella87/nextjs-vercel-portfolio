# UX Worldwide

Given the good results with Fairbnb, I started my own consultancy in early 2017 in Amsterdam and advised on mobile application development and UX Research, landing 2 main customers.

I mainly dived into hybrid application development and <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> using the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic Framework</a> , which is a Cross-Platform Mobile App Development framework created in 2003 by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry and Adam Bradley, which can tap into native device features through Cordova (without having to learn native languages ;).
