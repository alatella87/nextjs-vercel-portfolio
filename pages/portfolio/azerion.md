# Azerion B.V. (2018 - Present)

In July 2018, Azerion hired me to expand its gaming portals and products portfolio. I had the chance to work on 10+ projects, with different tech stacks.  

I also had the chance to participate in pivotal moments of the company evolution, by designing and developing ad-hoc marketing campaigns (internal/external) with huge impact.
  
Azerion is a Dutch technology and entertainment company, the result of the merger between [Improve Digital](https://improvedigital.com) and video game developer OrangeGames, based in Amsterdam. In addition to video games, Azerion offers a variety of technological solutions focused on improving the relationship between developers, publishers and gamers.<br/><br/>
