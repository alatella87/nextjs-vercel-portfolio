# Fairbnb Booking Platform

Fairbnb.coop started its journey in 2016 as a movement seeking to create an alternative to existing home-sharing platforms.

The movement emerged in Venice, Amsterdam and Bologna and pretty soon other groups from all over the world joined the debate and helped us in shaping the final model that got implemented.

In late 2018 we created a cooperative to serve as the legal entity behind the project - an open and inclusive organization - which is welcoming different types of actors.

We have now based our headquarters in Bologna, Italy.

I am a co-founder at Fairbnb, currently member of the cooperative and was part of the original team who served designs and frontend to the team.

Apart from day-to-day operations of a startup, my contribution focused on the designs and frontend execution of the community section, where social projects would receive funding from the booking transactions.

Here are the initial prototypes in AngularJS for the community section (booking-transactions funded projects)
