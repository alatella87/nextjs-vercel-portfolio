# Welcome

I'm Alessandro, a Frontend Developer from Switzerland, currently living in Amsterdam. I have worked in several industries such as tourism, gaming, factoring and sales.

My professional experience combines technological know-how in JS and its most modern frameworks (Vue.js, React, Angular) with a MSc. in human-centered technologies (User Experience) and BSc. Psychology. Recently, I started my journey towards full-stack by learning Node.js, MongoDB, Google Cloud tools and by adding TypeScript to my skills.

Last but not least, I love languages (not only programming languages, but also italian, french, spanish and dutch) and I usually cover more roles when joining a new company/venture. That means that usually the roll-out of an international digital product or service is smoother since I am able to foresee language barriers in adoption, but also cultural differences in appropriation and scaling.<br/><br/>
