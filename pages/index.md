Dear recruiter,

#### welcome to my online portfolio.

I'm Alessandro, a Frontend Developer from Switzerland, currently living in Amsterdam. I have worked in several industries such as tourism, gaming, factoring and sales.

My professional experience combines technological know-how in JS and its most modern frameworks (Vue.js, React, Angular) with a MSc. in human-centered technologies (User Experience) and a BSc. in Psychology. Recently, I started my journey towards full-stack by learning Node.js, MongoDB, Google Cloud tools and by adding TypeScript to my skill set.

Last but not least, I love languages (not only programming languages, but also italian, french, spanish and dutch) and I usually cover more roles when joining a new company/venture. That means that usually the roll-out of an international digital product or service is smoother since I am able to foresee language barriers in adoption, but also cultural differences in appropriation and scaling.  

To contact me, feel free to drop an email, InMail or simply call me.  

Best,

Ale
